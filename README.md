# Hi, I'm Gabriel 👋

I am your average height, nerdy game programmer that loves cats and games. I also code websites, paint with oils and make pixel art. I have a lot of passions, but my dream is to make games for a living!

I have experience in working with:

- **Game Engines**: GameMaker, Unity and (currently learning) Unreal Engine.
- **Languages**: C/C++, GML, C# and Lua

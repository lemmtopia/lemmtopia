## About 📔

I am your average height, nerdy programmer that loves cats and games. I also code websites, paint with oils and make pixel art. I have a lot of passions, but my dream is to make games for a living!
I am currently working as a Game Programmer at Afil Games, but I do my indie stuff in my free time. My stuff include games, virtual machines and websites.
